Technologies supporting big data and machine learning like hadoop are more than 10 years old.
If you think big data is a buzz word, then you are falling behind. 

Big data and machine learning is about three things in my mind:

* Ability to fetch and store large number of data.
* Ability to analyze big data efficently.
* Ability to use the data and enpower your business.


*Key competences and Technologies*

* Apache Storm, Flink, Spark
* Cassandra, Riak databases
